fetch data in React using a custom hook (useFetch) and a corresponding component (FetchData). By encapsulating data-fetching logic into reusable hooks, improve code maintainability. Mastering React's useState and useEffect hooks for managing state and asynchronous operations efficiently. Additionally, dynamically render fetched data on the UI with JSX, enabling the creation of dynamic and interactive components.
